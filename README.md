<ins>CIFAR-10 Image Classification:</ins>
This project is an implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal of this project is to train a model to recognize and classify images into one of ten classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

<ins>Dataset:</ins>
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. The dataset is provided by Keras as part of its built-in datasets.

<ins>Model:</ins>
We implemented a simple CNN architecture using Keras. The model consists of three convolutional layers with max-pooling, followed by two fully connected layers. We used the softmax activation function in the output layer to produce probability distributions over the 10 possible classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

During training, we used the Adam optimizer and the categorical cross-entropy loss function. We trained the model for 10 epochs, which achieved an accuracy of around 64% on the test set.

<ins>Conclusion:</ins>
This project demonstrates the basic steps involved in building a CNN for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. While the model's performance may not be state-of-the-art, it shows how to implement a simple CNN architecture and how to train and evaluate it on a small dataset. This project can be extended by trying different hyperparameters, optimization techniques, or more complex CNN architectures to improve the model's performance.
